# Crypto Scrap
## A flutter template app for cryptocurrency trading

### Check the project [here](https://luismagit.github.io/#/)

## Features:
* MVVM Architecture
* Light/Dark Mode
* Internationalization (Spanish, English)
* Responsive (Web ready)
* Cryptocurrency history price tracker with graph
* Animations

### Note: 
For price history tracker to work you need to provide your own [api key](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api) in `[scrap\lib\utils\api_helpers.dart]`. The tracker won' t work in the [web example](https://luismagit.github.io/#/) (Due to Cross-origin), but similiar behavior can be found [here](https://github.com/LuisMaGit/flutter_crypto)

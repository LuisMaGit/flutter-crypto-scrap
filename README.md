## Features:

### Note: 
For Price History Tracker to work you need to provide your own [api key](https://p.nomics.com/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-api) in`[scrap\lib\utils\api_helpers.dart]`. The tracker wont work in the [web example](https://luismagit.github.io/#/), but similiar behavior can be found [here](https://github.com/LuisMaGit/flutter_crypto)
